  
👋 Hi, I'm Aditi Srivastava, a Software Developer & Data Engineer with 2.7+ years of experience building scalable systems and data solutions.
I love creating scalable applications, automating ETL workflows, and innovating data systems using React, SQL, Python, Airflow, and Databricks.  

📊 I thrive on turning raw data into meaningful insights through frontend development, ECM migration, and data engineering.  
Passionate about growth, I continuously explore modern architectures and event-driven technologies to build impactful solutions.
